abstract = {This paper proposes an original method to compute an inner and an outer approximation of the image f(X) of a subset X of Rn (e.g., X is the unit ball) by a smooth nonlinear function f:Rn→Rn. A boundary approach is proposed. More precisely, the boundary ∂f(X) will be covered by parallelepipeds in order to get an accurate enclosure of f(X).}
